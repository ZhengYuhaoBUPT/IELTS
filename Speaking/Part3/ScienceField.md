1. Why do some children not like learning Science at school?  

Well, I reckon that many kids don't take a fancy to Science because of its complexity. They may find it daunting to grasp abstract concepts or complex formulas. Moreover, the theoretical part can be quite dull, given that it lacks the fun and vividness of hands-on experiments. Yet, I believe this situation could be tackled if teachers converge more on the practical side, making science both instructive and entertaining.

2. ls it important to study Science at school?  

Absolutely, studying Science at school plays a critical role in a student's holistic development. Firstly, it equips us with logical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential in all walks of life. Besides, it helps students understand the world around us, from why the leaves are green to how a spaceship works. Most importantly, in today's tech-driven world, knowledge of science is paramount. So, it's not just about getting good grades, but about being prepared for the future.

3. Which science subject is the most important for children to learn?  

In my view, it's difficult to pinpoint just one as all science subjects are crucial in their own ways, yet I reckon Physics is rather significant. It's not just about the study of matter and its motion, but fundamentally about understanding the world around us. It provokes curious minds to question and explore the universe's mysteries. However, in saying that, the importance may differ based on individual interests and career aspirations.

4. Should people continue to study Science after graduating from school?  

Well, I believe that continuing to study Science even after school, to some extent, is beneficial. Mainly because it's by studying Science that we understand how our world works. Moreover, it equips us with critical thinking skills which are highly sought after in today’s job market. Furthermore, Science is deeply integrated into our everyday lives, hence, being knowledgeable about it can be immensely helpful in making informed decisions.

5. How do you get to know about scientific news?

Oh, I get most of my scientific news online. You see, it's an age of information explosion, so it isn't hard to find information about science on the Internet. Social media platforms like WeChat have accounts dedicated to science news. Besides, I use websites like "Nature" and "Science Daily". They give me quality in-depth reports about the latest scientific discoveries. But remember, it's crucial to scrutinize the sources to ensure the information's authenticity.

6. Should scientists explain the research process to the public?  

Definitely, I believe scientists should explain their research to the public. It allows the average person to understand complex concepts, and it promotes transparency and trust in science. In China, many students in university are studying scientific majors, and if these scientific findings and materials are explained well, they can serve as valuable resources for these students. I reckon a general understanding of science can also encourage more informed decisions in society.
