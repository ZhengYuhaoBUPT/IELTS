观点：From my view, it's critical for governments to provide a framework that supports the elderly after they leave the workforce.  
论据（举例子）：In countries like China, retirement policies help manage the aging population by providing pensions which empower retirees to maintain a decent standard of living.

4. When do you think is the best time to retire?

总体回答：The best time to retire really depends on individual circumstances and what they hope to achieve after their professional life.  
观点：From my perspective, late 50s to early 60s seems like an optimal time.  
论据（举例子）：This is largely because, by this age, most professionals have reached the peak of their careers and have likely secured enough financial stability to enjoy life without full-time employment.  
其他观点：However, younger professionals today, particularly those in demanding tech jobs, might consider early retirement to pursue personal projects or travel.  
总结：So while traditional paths suggest a later retirement, evolving career dynamics and personal goals are leading more people to favor retiring earlier than previous generations.

论据（举例子）：For example, during festivals like the Spring Festival, spending time with grandparents can create cherished memories and allow for the passing down of traditions.  
其他观点：However, youngsters might feel that it's challenging to communicate with the older generation due to different interests or lifestyle choices.  
总结：Ultimately, while there may be generational differences, the emotional and cultural benefits of spending more time with grandparents are significant and rewarding.

总体回答：Living with elderly people can be highly beneficial, enriching both emotional well-being and cultural understanding.  
观点：I believe that one major advantage is the intergenerational learning that occurs.  
论据（举例子）：For instance, grandparents often share stories and life lessons, which can provide younger family members with a sense of history and wisdom that isn’t taught in schools.  
其他观点：Conversely, some may argue that there could be challenges, like differing lifestyles or the need for frequent health care assistance.  
总结：Nevertheless, the mutual benefits of companionship and shared family responsibilities usually outweigh these potential difficulties.  

key words: cultural understanding emotional well-being intergenerational learning provide a sense of wisdom differing lifestyles or the need for frequent health care assistance companionship
